We have three environments
- Staging (https://staging.yasmina.ai)
	- For testing new features
- Sandbox (https://sandbox.yasmina.ai)
	- A playground to test the integration. This is not a live database, so you're free to play around
- Production (https://portal.yasmina.ai)
	- Once you make sure everything is good. You can start working on this environment.
